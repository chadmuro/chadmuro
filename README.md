I'm a Software Engineer currently living in Tokyo, Japan, and born and raised in Hawaii. I have professional experience using TypeScript, React, Next.js, JavaScript, and Node.js. My preferred tech stack at the moment includes TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and TailwindCSS. When I'm not developing and building things, I enjoy writing blog articles, photography, basketball, and playing with my French Bulldog.
