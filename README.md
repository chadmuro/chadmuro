I'm a Software Engineer currently living in Tokyo, Japan, and born and raised in Hawaii. I have professional experience using TypeScript, React, Next.js, React Native, JavaScript, PHP, and Node.js. When I'm not developing and building things, I enjoy writing blog articles, photography, basketball, and playing with my French Bulldog.
